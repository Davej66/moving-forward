## Deployment

The project after the completed code has been committed and pushed to GitHub can be deployed and [found here.](https://davej66.github.io/dfg/). This is achieved by navigating to the page holding the project repository and executing the following steps:

1. From the menu select **Settings**.
2. Scrolling down the vertical menu (topped by Options) select **Pages** which leads to the **Source section**.

6. The website is live https://davej66.github.io/m2-travelseeker/ .

### To run the project locally github:
To achieve this by the following process;
1. Under the repository name and the menu that contains Gitpod click Code.
2. Select HTTPS the location will already be present.
3. To the right of this address is an icon once this clicked the location will be cloned.
4. the clone can be found at this [https://github.com/Davej66/book-club](https://github.com/Davej66/book-club).

### To run the project locally heroku:
To achieve this by the following process;
1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt.
2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command echo web: python app.py > Procfile.
3. git add and git commit the new requirements and Procfile and then git push the project to GitHub.
